<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Armaan Bhati, and I come from a solid background in hotel management with two years of experience in Dubai's vibrant 
hospitality industry. My journey in hotel management provided me with invaluable skills in customer service, teamwork, and organizational 
management. However, as I continued to grow professionally, I discovered a newfound passion for web and software development, prompting me to 
embark on a career transition. My time working in the front office department of a luxury hotel in Dubai exposed me to the importance of 
technology in delivering exceptional guest experiences. I realized that the digital landscape plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of 
not just the hospitality sector but various industries as well. This realization ignited my desire to explore the world of web and 
software development, where I see the opportunity to make a significant impact through innovative solutions.</p>

<p>Over the past months, I have dedicated myself to acquiring a strong foundation in web development, software engineering, and programming 
languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I have completed online courses, engaged in practical projects, and actively participated 
in developer communities to sharpen my skills and stay updated with industry trends.
My transition to web and software development is driven by my aspiration to leverage technology to create user-friendly, efficient, and visually 
appealing solutions. I believe that my background in hotel management equips me with a unique perspective on user experience and customer 
satisfaction, which I aim to integrate into my future projects as a developer.</p>

<p>I am excited about this new chapter in my career and the endless possibilities it offers in terms of personal and professional growth. 
I am eager to contribute my dedication, adaptability, and problem-solving skills to a dynamic team or project, and I am committed to continuously
improving and expanding my knowledge in the field.
Thank you for considering my journey and the skills I bring to the table. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and make a meaningful impact in the world of web and software development.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Armaan Bhati
